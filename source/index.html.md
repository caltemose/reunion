## [Things to Do Around Charleston](/todo)

There's plenty to do on the Isle of Palms where we're staying, especially if you like spending time at the beach. Add to that downtown Charleston and the surrounding region and we'll have no shortage of things to do.

Check out [this page for a list of things to do](/todo) and a bunch of links to websites for more details.

## Weather

It will be hot and humid. Guaranteed. That's why we have a/c, a pool, and the ocean.



## Packing

You may wish to consider bringing:

- a bathing suit
- suntan lotion
- a sun-blocking hat
- good walking shoes (Charleston still has a few cobblestone streets)



## Still To Come

We'll be adding more content to this site once we get closer and once we have some feedback from everyone in terms of scheduling things to do.

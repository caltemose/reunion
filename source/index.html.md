## Weather

It will be hot and humid. Guaranteed. That's why we have a/c, a pool, and the ocean.



## Packing

I'm not going to tell you what to bring but you should definitely consider:

- bathing suit
- suntan lotion
- a sun-blocking hat
- good walking shoes (Charleston still has a few cobblestone streets)


## Still To Come

We'll be adding more content to this site once we get closer and once we have some feedback from everyone in terms of scheduling things to do.
